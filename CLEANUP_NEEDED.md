# Cleanup Required

The following files and directories should be manually deleted as they are unused experimental code:

## Files to Delete

1. `/src/components/WidgetConfiguration.tsx` - Unused widget configuration dialog
2. `/src/components/widgets/` - Entire directory containing unused widget components:
   - `ActivityFeedWidget.tsx`
   - `QuickActionsWidget.tsx`
   - `RevenueWidget.tsx`
   - `StatsWidget.tsx`
   - `TodayScheduleWidget.tsx`
   - `UpcomingAppointmentsWidget.tsx`

These files were created but never integrated into the application and are not referenced anywhere in the codebase.

## Current State

The application currently uses:
- **Top navigation bar** (Navigation.tsx) with horizontal layout
- **Simple Dashboard** with 3 stat cards and today's schedule
- All core features are functional and working

The unused widget components were experimental code for a customizable dashboard feature that was never completed or integrated.
